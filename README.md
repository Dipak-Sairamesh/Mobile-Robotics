# Mobile-Robotics

Objective: In this lab, you will apply tools from the Robot Operating System (ROS) to build
a map of an initially unknown environment using maximum-likelihood-based graphical SLAM
and occupancy grid mapping, and then (globally) relocalize into that map using Monte Carlo
localization (MCL). 

Components : 
Map acquisition using Cartographer
Global relocalization using AMCL
